I want a spot for a portfolio, but I also want a blog. Since I only get one free site on Github, I may as well combine them.

## Things I've done

# Text classifier
Classify sentences with malware attributes. Built with Pandas and scikit-learn.

# Co-occurence network
Ingest a bunch of documents, extract named-entities, visualize their co-occurence network. Nodes are words, edges are weighted by frequency. Built with spaCy, networkx, and Plotly.

# Trading Algorithm Pipeline
Made with the Smith Investment Fund. Performs data ingestion, fundamental factor calculations, and backtesting. 

# FINRA Advisor network
Visualize financial advisors and their connections via concurrent employment. Made during Bitcamp.

# Topic visualizer
Ingest a bunch of text, run topic modelling (LDA) on it, visualize the results. Built with Gensim and Plotly.

# Spatio-temporal action detection
Classify actions in a video. Localize it over space and time. Built with Tensorflow and OpenCV.
