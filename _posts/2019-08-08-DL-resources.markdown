I, like many other people, enjoy reading about AI. I thought it might be helpful (and mildly cathartic) to create a list of topics/resources I think are important. Links to be included later!

# Contents
1. Machine Learning
2. Deep Learning
3. Computer Vision
4. Natural Language Processing
5. Other

# Resources
* Andrew Ng's Coursera course
* Stanford 231n (Vision)
* scikit-learn's documentation

# Machine Learning

Understand...
1. the math - MVC, LinAlg, conditional probability, Bayes' theorem.
2. the organization - (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement), (regression, classification, clustering...)(parametric, non-parameteric), etc.
3. the basics - linear regression, loss functions, gradient descent, hyperparameters, nearest neighbors, decision trees.
4. training and evaluation - over v. underfitting, cross-val, learning curves, F1.
5. regularization (L1, L2)
6. logistic regression, SVMs, naive Bayes.
7. perceptron, nonlinearities.
8. neural networks, backpropagation.
