I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science and Math. Some things I like (hopefully I'll write a post about one soon):

* Natural Language Processing
* Reinforcement Learning
* Data visualization
* Doing hackathons
* Financial analysis
* Chess

I want a spot for a portfolio, but I also want a blog. Since I only get one free site on Github, I may as well combine them.
